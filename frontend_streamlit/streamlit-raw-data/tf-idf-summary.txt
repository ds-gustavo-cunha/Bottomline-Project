If you want to learn practical and technical skills that will enable you to quickly create your projects from scratch, or join a tech startup as a developer, product manager or growth marketer, our coding bootcamps are the perfect education experience.
We originally created our coding bootcamps with a full-time format: 9 intensive weeks to learn Web Development or Data Science.
If you are looking for more technical autonomy, freedom and drive, coding is definitely a tool that will help you get there - either to launch your own company, become a full-time or freelance developer, or develop technical projects in your current job.
During the last 2 weeks of our Web Development course, our students learn how to build robust and beautiful web applications by themselves, likewise  students work on real data science projects at the end of our Data Science course.
During our 9-week (full-time) or 24-week (part-time) coding bootcamp, learn the most in-demand skills with motivated students, passionate teachers and a hands-on curriculum teaching you how to build software and solve problems.
All our students learn to collaborate within a team of developers or data scientists and adopt the technical workflow followed by most successful tech companies.
During our bootcamp, we teach you how successful startups work: design your project's wireframe & mockup, test your UX with a prototype, split your user stories across your team and collaborate with branch and pull requests with git and Github
