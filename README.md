## Step 01. Business Understanding:
Understand what is the problem we are trying to solve and what are the main concerns of this problem.

## Step 02. Data Understanding:
Understand what data we have available and plan how to use data science tools to solve the business problem.

## Step 03. Data Preparation:
Remove punctuation, mispellings and irrelevant text and prepare the data for model training


## Step 04. Modelling:
Use machine learning and deep learning technique to extract patterns on the data and make relevant predictions.

## Step 05. Evaluation:
Evaluate the results from modelling and check if the product so far is able to be deployed or need further improvements to be deployed.

## Step 06. Deploy:
Deploy the product of the respective project iteration so that user can use the product and give it a feedback.

## Restart the cycle:
Use the feedback from last project iteration and also user feedback to make improvements to the next project cycle.

# **CONCLUSIONS**

**TO-DO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

# **LESSONS LEARNED**

**How to do an end-to-end NLP Data Science project.**

**How to create the whole data architecture for the app (and its API) on Google Cloud Platform.**

**Use Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to do text summarization.**

**Use Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to do sentiment analysis.**

**How to create a user friendly app and also take the UX into account when designing data apps.**

**Work in cycles creating MVPs, validating its solution on user feedbacks and improving the solution on the next project cycle1.**

**Working on presentation and storytelling so even people without data science background could understand our project and use our final product**

# **NEXT STEPS TO IMPROVE**

**Sentiment Analysis**: train the model on a larger dataset.

**Data cleaning**: test data cleaning step on a larger range of possible misleading text input.

**User input**: allow user to input PDF and DOCX files.

**Web scraping**: make the web scraping more robust to different website HTML codes.

**UX**: improve UX for mobile usage.
